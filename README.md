# Starlink Constellation Collision Risk Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes satellite collision risks in dense orbital environments using spatial indexing techniques.

A KD-Tree based approach is used to efficiently identify nearby satellites and prioritize high-risk conjunction events.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- KD-Tree
- Plotly / Dash (optional)

## Key Features
- Scalable collision screening using KD-Tree
- Data preprocessing pipelines for orbital datasets
- Risk prioritization of close-proximity satellite events
- Visualization of high-risk encounters

## Outcome
Built a prototype system to analyze dense satellite constellations and identify potential collision zones.
