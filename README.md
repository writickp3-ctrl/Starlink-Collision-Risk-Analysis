# Starlink Constellation Collision Risk Analysis 🚀

## Description

This project analyzes satellite collision risks in dense orbital environments using spatial indexing techniques.

A KD-Tree based approach is used to efficiently identify nearby satellites and prioritize high-risk conjunction events.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- KD-Tree  
- Plotly / Dash (optional)  

---

## Key Features

- Scalable collision screening using KD-Tree  
- Data preprocessing pipelines for orbital datasets  
- Risk prioritization of close-proximity satellite events  
- Visualization of high-risk encounters  

---

## Outcome

Built a prototype system to analyze dense satellite constellations and identify potential collision zones.
